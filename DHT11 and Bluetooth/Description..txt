                 1. Temperature and Humidity Sensor  - DHT 11
   
DHT11 is interfaced with Arduino as shown in Fig1.png file  using jumper wires
Once it is successfully interfaced, connect the arduino board to the laptop with a USB cable
Open Arduino IDE and include the “dht library file” by pressing on
 → Sketch
 → Include library file 
 → DHT on the top left corner.
Type the given code, compile and upload

(NOTE: the entire code is given in the INO file named "Code")
   
        


After uploading check the temperature and humidity value by clicking on 
  → Tools
  → Serial monitor  

                                               2. Bluetooth - HC05 



Connect HC05 bluetooth to arduino as shown in Fig2.png file along with the temperature sensor DHT11
Download the app  Bluetooth Terminal HC05
In the app give bluetooth access and press on scan
Select our interfaced device and  enter pin i.e, either 0000 or 1234
 After pairing the device press the 
→ Tools
→ Serial monitor on Arduino IDE

The temperature and humidity value is now displayed on to the app as seen in Fig3.png file
